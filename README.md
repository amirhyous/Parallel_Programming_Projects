# Parallel Programming Projects

This repository contains parallel codes of 4 different problems:

Q1. **Finding the minimum value and its corresponding index in an array**

Q2. **Calculating the mean and standard deviation of values in an array**

Q3. **Calculating different pixel values between two images**

Q4. **Overlaying one image onto another with adjustable transparency**

All problems have been solved using three different parallelism methods: SIMD, OpenMP, and POSIX.
