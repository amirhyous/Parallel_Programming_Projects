# Parallel Programming Projects
This repository contains parallel codes of 4 different problems:
Q1. **Finding minimum value and its coresponding index in an array:**
   Implements a subset of the ARMv5 instruction set, including data processing,            load/store, and branch instructions.
2. **Pipelined Execution:** Supports a basic 5-stage pipeline (fetch, decode, execute, memory, write-back) to enhance instruction throughput.
